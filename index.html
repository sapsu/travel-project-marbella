              <p>
                Marbella is a city and resort area on southern Spain’s Costa del
                Sol, part of the Andalusia region. The Sierra Blanca Mountains
                are the backdrop to 27 km of sandy Mediterranean beaches,
                villas, hotels, and golf courses. West of Marbella town, the
                Golden Mile of prestigious nightclubs and coastal estates leads
                to Puerto Banús marina, filled with luxury yachts, and
                surrounded by upmarket boutiques and bars.
              </p>

                Marbella is rich in culture and history that is lesser known to
                the average tourist. Marbella was conquered by the Romans in
                approximately 1600 BC. They named the city Salduba, which means
                Salt City. Remains of the Roman era can still be found
                throughout the city. Marbella was also ruled by Arabs for nearly
                9 centuries. This is still evident today by the Moorish
                architecture in various parts of the city. In 1485 Marbella was
                conquered by the Spanish Catholic Monarchs led by King Fernando.
                In the centuries to come, Marbella history as well as the town
                went through dramatic changes. In a short span of only the last
                about 50 years, Marbella has been transformed from a small
                fishing and farming village into an international tourist
                destination.
